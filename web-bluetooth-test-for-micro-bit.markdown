Web Bluetooth Test for micro:bit
--------------------------------
This is a demo that illustrates a way to connect a micro:bit and a PC running the Chome web browser using the Web Bluetooth API and displays acceleration values measured by an acceleration sensor on the micro:bit as a simple 3D animation.

You can get the code for micro:bit at https://makecode.microbit.org/_dafDeM1zEa4o

Note: You have to open this Pen in the Debug Mode to use the Web Bluetooth API. Otherwise, the Feature Policy (implemented in Chrome 64) prevents you from connecting. See https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/06/feature-policy
