Web Bluetooth with micro:bit (Acceleration)
-------------------------------------------
This is a demo that illustrates a way to connect a micro:bit and a PC running the Chome web browser using the Web Bluetooth API and displays acceleration values measured by an acceleration sensor on the micro:bit as a simple 3D animation.

You can get the code for micro:bit at https://makecode.microbit.org/_dafDeM1zEa4o

Note: You have to open this Pen in the Debug Mode, since the Web Bluetooth doesn't work on cross-origin iframes.
